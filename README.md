## Project Information

General information about the Save the Pony app and repository.

### Tech Stack

Here are some of the key frameworks used to create this app:

- React
- Typescript
- CSS Modules
- Vitest
- React Testing Library
- Mock Service Worker

### Features

- Responsive - uses a component-based design to natively support across all devices
- Accessibility - each page passes WCAG-2.1 accessibility standard (verified with Axe dev tool)
- Form validation - native HTML validation is used for fast client side validation, and any errors returned from the backend are displayed on the form.
- Experimental View Transitions API - Makes use of new viewTransitions API where supported to allow animated transition between form screen and maze screen.

### Potential Improvements

- Allow for a soft reset so that the user can recreate a game with the settings they previously set up
- Add a timer to gamify the app more
- Add local leaderboard - Add a leaderboard of times, could be stored in localstorage to prevent need to implement any authentication
- Add co-ordinate system to describe where the items are - to assist with accessibility

### Testing

Vitest is used as the test framework to provide super fast results. To run, do the following steps:

1. To run all tests:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

2. To run coverage across components

   ```bash
   npm run coverage
   ```

### Notes

Existing bug in backend - if you make an invalid move as the domokun is approaching you it doesnt count as a loss and you can carry on the game.
